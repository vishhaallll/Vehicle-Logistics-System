### Why I'm Building This
Logistics management is stuck in the 90s. I saw businesses drowning in spreadsheets—tracking shipments, driver advances, and fuel costs manually.
I am building **Vehicle Logistics Pro** to solve this.

### 🏗️ Features (Implemented & Planned)

**✅ Completed (Beta):**
*   **Core Dashboard:** Real-time stats for Vehicle/Weight/Revenue.
*   **Data Entry:** Auto-complete forms that learn from previous entries (Zero Excel needed).
*   **Theme Engine:** Fully functional Dark/Light mode toggle.
*   **Basic Reports:** Daily shipment tracking.

**🚧 In Progress:**
*   **Advanced Billing:** Automating GST invoice generation.
*   **Profit/Loss Engine:** Real-time calculation of trip profitability.
*   **PDF Exports:** Generating audit-ready driver reports.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
I am building this in public using a 100% Python stack:
*   **Language:** Python 3.12
*   **GUI:** Tkinter + `ttkbootstrap` (Custom Styling)
*   **Data Persistence:** SQLite (Local)
*   **Analysis:** Pandas
